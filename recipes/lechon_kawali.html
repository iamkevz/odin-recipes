    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lechon kawali with a cup of rice please! This is my regular order at least
      once a week when I was in high school. Our school canteen serves one of
      the best versions of this dish. I like it best when the pork just go out
      of the pot. It is suepr crispy and hot.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lbs. pok belly</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons whole pepper corn</li>
      <li>5 pieces dried bay leaves</li>
      <li>3 cups cooking oil</li>
      <li>34 ounces water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour water on cooking pot. Boil</li>
      <li>
        Add the pork belly and 1 tablespoon of salet. Put some pepper and bay
        leaves. Boil for 30 minutes or until meat gets tender
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the meat from the pot and let it cool down for a few minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1 tablespoon of salt on the pork belly. Make sure to distribute
        it evenly on all sections
      </li>
      <li>Start to deep fry the boiled meat. Heat oil on a cooking pot.</li>
      <li>
        Put each piece of boiled pork belly into the hot oil with extra caution.
        Fry until crispy. Turn the meat over to completely fry the opposite side
        until crispy. Note: be extra careful when frying as oil can splatter.
        You can use the cover of the pot to cover it while oil splatters, but do
        not cover completely as steam will be trapped. It will cause more
        splatters.

        down. Slice according to desired portions
